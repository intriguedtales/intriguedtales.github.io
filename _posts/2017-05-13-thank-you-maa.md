“MAA!! AMMA!! where are you? MAA! I am Home!” I yell at the top of my voice. No answer. “MAA?” suddenly a fear grips me. where did she go? but then I hear her voice “I am right here. oh god! do you really have to yell that way? you startled the living daylight out of me.” she kept scolding me, and yet I watched her with peace. She’s here. She’s right here with me. I couldn’t keep myself from giving her one of my tightest hugs.

My Maa is my safe haven.

Maa. The sound of that name renders such a sheltered feeling in us. Doesn’t it?

As I am about to leave home (AGAIN) and I have so much to look forward to, there are few things which I don’t want to be changed, like coming back home to my mom, where I can be myself, where I can lie on her lap and pour my heart out, where I can laugh with her in any possible situation and hear her speak about her love for Japanese. As I am typing this, my mind runs back to so many memories of growing up under the warmth of mom’s love.

There are questions that we need to ask ourselves.  Do we tell this enough to our respective mums, that we really love them? Do we tell them, that we are there for her, the way they are there for us? Do we go and give them random hugs, and tell them that everything will be fine?

DO WE?

I am very well aware of the fact that we all love our moms way too much, but sometimes it becomes imperative that we express the same love out in the open, that we have in our hearts. Life is unforeseeable and lets not wait for ‘Mother’s day’ to arrive each year and knock on our doors to remind us that we love our moms.

They are so many things , in fact there are infinite number of things, that I am thankful to my Mom for, and out of all those infinite things, you all might relate to the following:

* Thank you Mom, for teaching me the importance of compassion and raising me with social responsibility.
* Thank you Mom, for all those late nights , when I was fast asleep and you were awake all night worried about me.
* Thank you Mom, for all those Candid photographs that you clicked whilst I was enjoying and cherishing my childhood.
* Thank you Mom, for teaching me that its okay, if we fail in our lives at times and its okay to not be the perfect version of ourselves.
* Thank you Mom, for making me independent and allowing me to travel my heart’s content.
* Thank you Mom, for holding me, for cradling me and teaching me to be strong and emotionally intelligent.
* Thank you Mom, for keeping me in place, when I really needed to be in one.

THANK YOU MOM, FOR BEING YOU

I am a twenty three old woman today who feels more empowered, more strong and more confident and loved, and this wouldn’t have been possible without my Maa, without my best friend, who has accepted me, yelled at me, loved me, punished me when required. Since I was a kid and up to now, I have always looked up to my mom with so much of awe, pride and fondness, while she spoke to others or doing some chores. Sometimes I would used to walk into her room and drape her sarees around me, just to look like her, and she would hide behind the door, and look down at me with fondness. Today I wear those sarees with expertise, but the fondness in her eyes, still remains the same. That’s how pure a mother’s love is.

This heartfelt thank you note is not just for my mom, its for every mom out there who lives, struggles, loves and fights for her child. GO! and tell her that you love her.
