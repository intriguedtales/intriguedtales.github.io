Ever read a book, and realized how those words could have changed your life? It might not be the plot or a character, but those words which create that urge in your head, to read more. Today I am not going to write about a particular book, but about that particular metaphor in my head which I call a  ‘Green Door’.
Why a Green Door ?
The colour Green for me is the colour of tranquility, the colour which brings peace to your eyes when you see Trees sway to the wind. When I feel that gate open in my head, that’s when I feel that real personal connection to those words while reading a book.

Every Author has a personality which is automatically reflected in the words that He/She writes. Its pretty evident, especially when you read fiction. When you relate yourself to a book, its more of relating yourself to the entire universe in a writer’s head. The beauty behind personal writing is that, a writer will never have a filter while expressing anything behalf of his/her characters. They have a beauty of planting a part of their souls in the characters that they mold, and that brings out the beauty in the words they write.
Its like writing a beautiful letter to your readers.
In all my years of reading books, I have always found a personal tunnel to reaching a writer’s mind, especially when I read a book by a woman author. I remember reading ‘The Namesake’ by Jhumpa Lahiri, which focused on the lives of an immigrant Bengali couple, and their struggles in adapting themselves and raising their kids in an alien country. The most distinguishing point for me, was how beautifully the author could describe melancholy in that book, that it broke my heart.

Somehow without even realizing, I started picking out books which had more of a personal element in them. Personal writing is like a rainbow amidst thick clouds, when you least expect anything good to happen, you feel something unexpectedly splendid. That’s what personal writing does to you, it would not want you to leave the book until you get to the end of it. It’s like being in a conversation, which can’t be left until we are done knowing the other person. Women authors have that innate quality in them. They have the ability to tug your heart strings, by just making their characters more believable.

Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s depiction of Draupadi’s character in ‘The Palace Of Illusions’ is surprisingly the most bewildering yet powerful. When we read Mahabharata, it’s all about how Draupadi’s insult led to the saga, that left us with so many life lessons. Alternatively when I read Divakaruni’s depiction of Draupadi, it left me wondering about everyday’s struggles of a woman living in a man’s world. That’s the beauty of personal writing, it shows the kaleidoscope of words in so many patterns and colours.

In the past few years, I have read an array of women authors, starting from Margaret Atwood, Kavita Kane, Anita Desai, Virginia Woolf, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Arundati Roy, Sudha Murthy, Nilanjana Gupta, Manju Kapur and Jhumpa Lahiri; while continuing reading Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen. What I have observed while reading the work by these erstwhile authors is that, though the characters are different in their backgrounds and stories, the aesthetics and the emotion behind molding that character comes from their spontaneous ability of expressing their emotions, which creates the foundation to a beautiful form of personal writing.

This is not an ode that I am paying to women authors, but it’s more of my sheer observance towards how building characters with ever lasting words, can bring a different perspective to the books that we read.
More power to anyone, who try to put their heart and soul in words!
